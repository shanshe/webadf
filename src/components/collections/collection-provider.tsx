// at all -- two separate DndContexts cannot see each other's draggables.

// This file owns onDragEnd and nothing about rendering: the rail and the

// useDraggable/useDroppable, tagged with the drag-data shapes exported below.

// guessing from ids, which would break the moment a game id and a collection
// id happened to collide (both are randomUUID()s from unrelated tables, so
// nothing rules that out).

/**
 * Resolve the drop from the POINTER, not from the dragged card's rectangle.
 *
 * dnd-kit's default is `rectIntersection`, which picks whichever droppable the
 * DRAGGED ELEMENT overlaps most. A library card is about 178x200; a rail row
 * is about 198x31 with a couple of pixels between rows. So one card covers
 * three or four rows at once, and the one with the greatest overlap is
 * routinely NOT the one under the cursor -- a title would land in the
 * collection above or below the one being aimed at, with nothing on screen
 * explaining why. Reported as "it's hard to spot which collection you are
 * actually hitting"; the aiming was the bug, the missing highlight only hid it.
 *
 * `pointerWithin` requires the pointer to be inside the droppable, which is
 * how a person believes dragging works, and it is what lets the rail's
 * highlight be honest: the row lighting up is the row `over` resolves to,
 * because both read the same value.
 *
 * The `rectIntersection` fallback is not decoration -- `pointerWithin` needs
 * pointer coordinates and returns nothing without them (a keyboard sensor, if
 * one is ever added), and silently dropping nothing would be worse.
 *
 * The droppable the pointer is in also gets the ZONE of that droppable the
 * pointer is in (src/lib/set-folder.ts), on its collision's `data.zone`, and
 * the pointer itself on `data.pointer`, and the slot's middle on `data.middle`.
 * Computed here and nowhere else because this is the one place where the
 * pointer and the droppable rects are guaranteed to be the same frame, and
 * those rects are dnd-kit's transform-agnostic measurements: a card the
 * reorder preview has nudged aside still answers for its own slot, so the
 * centre cannot slide out from under the pointer. Only a card-on-card drag
 * inside a collection reads it; every other drag ignores it.

 * The collision detection inside a collection view: the same as above, and

 * (operator, 2026-09-29).
 *
 * `pointerWithin` answers nothing in the 16 px gutters of the grid, so a
 * person who let go between two cards got no `over` at all and the drop was
 * silently ignored -- one of the ways "it does not detect the re-ordering".
 * Here the pointer is given to the card whose slot's middle is closest, as
 * that card's EDGE: a drop there reorders to its position, and a rest there
 * shows the same reorder preview as a rest in the card's own edge. A gap is
 * never a centre, so it never arms.
 *
 * "In the grid" is the box around every card's slot. A pointer outside it
 * -- the rail, the header, the empty page below -- keeps the plain answer,
 * so a drop there still does nothing, and a drop on a rail row (which
 * `pointerWithin` finds) is untouched. Only a GAME drag gets the fallback: a
 * collection dragged in the rail has no business landing on a card.
 *
 * One exception to "nearest": the empty cells after the LAST card, in a
 * partial last row. Nearest would give them to the card above (at 1280 with
 * six cards, index 3 rather than the end), and to a different card at phone
 * width than at desktop. A person dropping there means "at the end", so a
 * pointer in the last card's row band, to its right, goes to the last card
 * (operator ruling 2026-09-29: append). With a single row there are no such
 * cells inside the box -- the box ends at the last card -- so a drop to the
 * right of a lone row stays outside the grid and does nothing.
 *
